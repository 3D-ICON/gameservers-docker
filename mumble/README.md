### Mumble

Work in progress.

Downloads latest murmur and runs.

* `SUPER_USER_PASSWORD` - sets super user password if the sqlite database doesn't already exist.

Pass `MUMBLE_RELEASE` to `docker build` to use a specific mumble release instead of the latest.

TODO: 
* add all the env vars
* configure mumble.ini
